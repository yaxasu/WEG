## Introduction

The World's Easiest Game leverages genetic algorithms to evolve a player through various challenges. Experiment with different settings to see how the AI adapts and improves over generations.

## Features

- AI-powered gameplay using genetic algorithms
- Adjustable parameters for population size, mutation rate, and evolution speed
- Real-time updates and visualizations of AI progress

## Installation

To run the World's Easiest Game locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yaxasu/WEG.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd WEG
    ```
3. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

## Usage

Once you have the game running, you can adjust various parameters to influence the AI's evolution:

- **Population Size**: Change the number of individuals in each generation.
- **Mutation Rate**: Adjust the likelihood of random mutations occurring.
- **Evolution Player Speed**: Control the speed at which the AI plays the game.
- **Moves Increase**: Set how many additional moves the AI gets every few generations.

Experiment with these settings to see how they impact the AI's performance.

## Configuration

The main settings can be adjusted directly in the game interface under the "Change Values" section. 

### Controls

- **Population Size**: Use the `+` and `-` buttons to increase or decrease the population size.
- **Mutation Rate**: Use the `1/2` and `x2` buttons to halve or double the mutation rate.
- **Evolution Player Speed**: Use the `+` and `-` buttons to adjust the speed.
- **Moves Increase**: Use the `+` and `-` buttons to adjust the number of moves added every few generations.
